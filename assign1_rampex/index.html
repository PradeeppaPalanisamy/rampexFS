   <h2>MERN STACK:</h2>

   <p>The MERN stack is a powerful and popular technology stack for building modern web applications, comprising MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It enables full-stack development using JavaScript, streamlining the process by allowing developers to work seamlessly across the frontend and backend. MongoDB serves as the database, storing data in a flexible JSON-like format, while Express.js and Node.js handle server-side logic and API creation. React.js powers the user interface with its dynamic, component-based architecture. Known for its scalability, efficiency, and versatility, MERN is widely used for creating single-page applications, e-commerce sites, and real-time web platforms.</p>
